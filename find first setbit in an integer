2 010  here first set bit from right is at 2 nd place 
3 011  here first set bit from right is at 1st place
4 100 here first set bit from right is at 3rd place
we have to find how many times we have to count from right hand side to find the first bit


int findPosition(int n)
{
if(!n)
return -1;

int count=0;
while(n)
{
++count;
if(n&1)
{
n=n>>1;
break;
}
n=n>>1;
}
cout<<count<<endl;
